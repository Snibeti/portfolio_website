		<h3>About Me</h3>
	
		<p>Hello my name is Sarah Bray and I am a junior at Drexel studying Interactive Digital Media and minoring in Marketing. I have approximately three years of experience in the industry: making websites for friends, freelance work with local businesses, and designing and implementing sites for The University of Pennsylvania. I plan to become a user experience designer upon graduation, while maintaining my roots in marketing.
		<br><br>
		Design was always something I was attracted to. Drawing, painting, sculpting, mixed media, fashion, or anything creative, I would always love to design and create. My room would be littered with the elements of my ongoing projects: sketch books, magazine clippings and other odds and ends. I loved the process of getting out all of the crazy ideas I had going on in my head. A lot of my earlier projects were inspired by the wild fantasy environments I experienced in the video games I played. The detailed world fascinated me, and I quickly became obsessed with experiencing different kinds of games.
		<br><br>
		Today, not much has changed about me. Drawing is one of my favorite past times, along with playing indie games. I'm a huge Japanophile, loving its pop and traditional culture and their particular design aesthetic. Currently I am studying to become fluent in Japanese, 5 years in and I think I am finally getting there!
		<br><br>
		In a few years I dream to have a job in which I don't have to worry about debt, an apartment far-but-not-too-far from my family, a dog (maybe a few) and a portfolio to be proud of. I believe that if I work hard enough, perhaps I will reach a senior position at a company as a project manager. <i>"Today I know that there is still work to be done, but along the way my I am achieving my dreams."</i> - Candace Parker
