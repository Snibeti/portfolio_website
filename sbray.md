#### Website Inspiration

[Alex Motzenbecker's Personal Site](http://www.mstudio.com/)

I like this website for its use of simple colors to distinguish the different navigation sections. The navbar is on the left side with it always being visible regardless of what page is being viewed. In addition, the use of 3D interactivity is unique and gives the site a very polished feel. Although this is out of the scope of what is possible in this class, i think this is a good site to look at as far as simple and concise personal portfolios.

This website is very clean with the use of a dark overlay over her image to bring out the bold colors used in the title text. It is overall very aethetically pleasing. Viewing the website is similar to looking at a powerpoint presentation, as there is no scrolling down the page, but a transition from project to project. I think this is an effective way to view a portfolio, and it may be interesting trying to incorporate such transitions into my site.

[Melanie Daveid's Personal Site](http://melaniedaveid.com/)

This is one of my favorite websites because it brings all elements of good design and usability into one package of a satisfying experience to view. There is a simple color scheme, with one long page where all her information can be scrolled through. When a site is well designed, I find it very pleasing to just keep scrolling rather than halting to click another tab or link. While navigating, one side of the page stays solid for a period of time where the navigation tabs can still be reached. Overall very clean, with amazing entry animations.


#### About Me

Hello my name is Sarah Bray and I am a junior at Drexel studying Interactive Digital Media and minoring in Marketing. I have approximately three years of experience in the industry: making websites for friends, freelance work with local businesses, and designing and implementing sites for The University of Pennsylvania. I plan to become a user experience designer upon graduation, while maintaining my roots in marketing.

Design was always something I was attracted to. Drawing, painting, sculpting, mixed media, fashion, or anything creative, I would always love to design and create. My room would be littered with the elements of my ongoing projects: sketch books, magazine clippings and other odds and ends. I loved the process of getting out all of the crazy ideas I had going on in my head. A lot of my earlier projects were inspired by the wild fantasy environments I experienced in the video games I played. The detailed world fascinated me, and I quickly became obsessed with experiencing different kinds of games.

Today, not much has changed about me. Drawing is one of my favorite past times, along with playing indie games. I'm a huge Japanophile, loving its pop and traditional culture and their particular design aesthetic. Currently I am studying to become fluent in Japanese, 5 years in and I think I am finally getting there!

In a few years I dream to have a job in which I don't have to worry about debt, an apartment far-but-not-too-far from my family, a dog (maybe a few) and a portfolio to be proud of. I believe that if I work hard enough, perhaps I will reach a senior position at a company as a project manager. _"Today I know that there is still work to be done, but along the way my I am achieving my dreams."_ - Candace Parker
